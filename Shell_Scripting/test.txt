🧠 Analogy
Imagine a room:
•	A semaphore is like a room that can hold up to N people at once.
o	Each person entering calls wait() → count decreases.
o	Each leaving calls signal() → count increases.
•	A mutex is like a room that allows only 1 person at a time.
o	Only the person who locked the door can unlock it.
So, a mutex = binary semaphore + ownership rule.
🧠 What is a Counting Semaphore?
A counting semaphore is a synchronization tool that allows up to N threads to access a resource concurrently.
It maintains a counter:
•	When a thread wants to use the resource → it decrements the counter (acquire() or wait()).
•	When a thread finishes → it increments the counter (release() or signal()).
If the counter reaches 0, any other threads trying to enter must wait until someone releases it.
 
🏗 for-Example Scenario
Suppose you have 3 printers, and multiple threads (users) want to print.
At most 3 users can print simultaneously — the others must wait.
That’s a counting semaphore problem. 🎯
